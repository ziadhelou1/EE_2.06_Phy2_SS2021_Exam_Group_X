# Task 03: Produce a short video explaining your work.

Produce a short video in which you explain your work. Save the video in the local sub-folder [video](./video/) and push it to your repo.

In case the video becomes too large gitlab would refuse the file to be uploaded. Then we have to fid another way, e.g. providing a sciebo upload area.
